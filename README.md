The Idea
----
[Fhellow](fhellow.heroku.com) is the brain child of Alisa Afkhami, a freelance designer. Alisa found, like many freelancers eventually do, that whilst being a freelancer has many benefits it can also be a lonely profession. Freelancers are unable to tap into a professional network for contacts, benefits and social discourse, until now. Alisa ASoa social networking site for freelance professionals. A place to connect and chat with Fhellow freelancers and build a professional network without an office.
